    .SYNOPSIS
        Checks whether the current host is virtualization ready and
        whether the command is running inside a virtual machine.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Performs a series of checks to determine if CPU virtualization
        extensions (VT‑x or AMD‑V) are available and enabled, whether
        conflicting Windows features such as Hyper‑V are installed and
        whether this session is executing on a VMware guest.  For now
        this function prints stubbed results and instructs the user
        that full checks will be implemented later.

    .PARAMETER Detailed
        When specified, prints verbose details about each check.
