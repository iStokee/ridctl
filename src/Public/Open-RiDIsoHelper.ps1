    .SYNOPSIS
        Guides the user through obtaining or selecting a Windows ISO.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Presents interactive prompts to determine whether the user
        already has a Windows ISO available and if not, offers
        assisted download via the Microsoft website or an automated
        download using the Fido script.  This stub implementation
        simply writes a warning that the full feature is under
        construction and returns `$null`.

    .EXAMPLE
        PS> Open-RiDIsoHelper
        WARNING: ISO helper is not yet implemented.
    #>
    [CmdletBinding()] param()

    Write-Warning 'Open-RiDIsoHelper is not yet implemented. Please wait for a future release.'
    return $null
