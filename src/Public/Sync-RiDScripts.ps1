function Sync-RiDScripts {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Synchronises scripts between the host and the VMware guest.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Compares files in the configured sync folder with those in the
        VM shared folder and copies newer versions according to the
        selected direction.  Supports dryâ€‘run mode, bidirectional
        synchronisation and conflict resolution.  This stub
        implementation warns that the feature is incomplete.

    .PARAMETER FromShare
        Copy files from the VM shared folder to the host.

    .PARAMETER ToShare
        Copy files from the host to the VM shared folder.

    .PARAMETER Bidirectional
        Perform a bidirectional sync, resolving conflicts as
        configured.

    .PARAMETER DryRun
        Show what would change without copying any files.
