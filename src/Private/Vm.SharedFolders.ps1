    Provides helper functions for enabling and managing shared folders
    for VMware guest VMs.  These functions will call into vmrun or
    other tooling to enable shared folders, add and remove shares and
    verify their availability from the guest.  Currently unimplemented.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Enables and configures a shared folder for a VM using vmrun.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Wrapper around vmrun to enable shared folders, remove an
        existing share with the same name and add the new share.  In
        this scaffold implementation the commands are printed to the
        console instead of being executed.
