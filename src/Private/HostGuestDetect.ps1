function Get-RiDHostGuestInfo {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Determines whether the current session is running on a physical
        host or inside a virtual machine.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Uses WMI (Win32_ComputerSystem) to inspect the computer
        manufacturer and model.  If the manufacturer or model contains
        common hypervisor vendor names such as VMware, VirtualBox,
        KVM or Hyper-V then the machine is considered a guest.  In
        this early stub implementation the function returns a fixed
        result of `$false` indicating a physical host.

    .OUTPUTS
        [bool] True if running inside a VM, False if on a physical host.
