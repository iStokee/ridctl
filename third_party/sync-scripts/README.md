# sync-scripts

This directory is reserved for the [iStokee/sync-scripts](https://github.com/iStokee/sync-scripts)
repository which powers the synchronisation functionality in RiD.

When cloning the RiD repository, you can either add `sync-scripts` as a
Git submodule or vendor the contents directly under this folder.  In
this skeleton implementation no files are present.  Refer to the
`Sync.Core.ps1` module for integration points.
