# RiD Control

RiD is a PowerShell module and commandâ€‘line interface for managing
virtual machines used for development workflows.  It consolidates
existing guides for provisioning a VMware Workstation guest and
synchronising scripts between host and guest into a single tool.

This repository contains the source code for the module as well as
documentation, unit tests and build scripts.  The current state of
the project is a scaffold providing placeholders for future
implementation.  Refer to `USAGE.md` for a quick start guide.
