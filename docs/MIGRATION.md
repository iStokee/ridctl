# Migration Guide

Both the host and guest setup guides that previously described manual
steps for creating a VMware Workstation virtual machine, provisioning
shared folders and copying scripts are now superseded by the RiD
module.  This file will outline how to migrate from the legacy
processes to using RiD once the module is complete.

At present the module is under development and does not yet perform
these actions.  Check back in future releases for detailed migration
instructions.
